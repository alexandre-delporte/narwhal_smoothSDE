# narwhal_smoothSDE

Analyse of narwhal trajectory data using smoothSDE package by Michelot.

smoothSDE allows to fit Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and correlated velocity models as described in "Correlated velocity models as a fundamental unit of animal movement" Gurarie, Fleming 2017. Covariates can be included in the parameters within the GAMs (Generalized Additive Models) framework.
